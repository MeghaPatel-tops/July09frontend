The CSS @keyframes rule is used to control the steps in an animation sequence by defining CSS styles for points along the animation sequence.

An animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another. During an animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.

Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.

@keyframes name {
  keyframes-selector {css-styles;}
  keyframes-selector {css-styles;}
  ...
}
