===============================================================================
8. What is a template literal?
  ANS:A template literal is a modern way (introduced in ES6) to create strings in JavaScript using backticks (`) instead of quotes.

Template literals allow:

✔ String interpolation (embedding variables)
✔ Multi-line strings
✔ Expression evaluation
✔ Tagged templates
================================================================================
9. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations and ensures that non-blocking code runs efficiently, even though JavaScript itself is single-threaded.

It continuously checks:

Is the call stack empty?

If yes, can we take a callback/task from the queue and run it?

This process keeps JavaScript responsive.
1. Call Stack

Where JavaScript executes your code line by line.

2. Web APIs / Browser APIs

Handle async tasks like:

setTimeout

fetch

DOM events

Promises

3. Task Queues

There are two main queues:

✔ Callback (Macro) Task Queue

Contains tasks like:

setTimeout

setInterval

click events

✔ Microtask Queue

Contains:

Promise .then()

async/await callbacks

MutationObserver

👉 Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks.

4. Event Loop

The event loop continuously:

Checks if the call stack is empty

If empty → pushes tasks from the microtask queue first, then macrotasks

10. What is the difference between null and undefined?
| Feature         | **null**                                     | **undefined**                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning**     | Intentional absence of value                 | Variable declared but not assigned           |
| **Type**        | `object` (bug in JS)                         | `undefined`                                  |
| **Set by**      | Developer (you manually assign it)           | JavaScript (automatically)                   |
| **Typical Use** | Represents "empty", "nothing", or "no value" | Represents "not assigned", "not defined yet" |
| **Equality**    | `null == undefined` → true                   | `null === undefined` → false                 |
===================================================================
11. What is closure in JavaScript?
A closure is formed when an inner function remembers and can access variables from its outer function’s scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

In simple words:

👉 Closure = function + its lexical (outer) environment
=====================================================================

12. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?

Synchronous code runs one line at a time and blocks further execution until the current task finishes.

✔ Executes in sequence
✔ Each task waits for the previous one
✔ Can cause blocking (slow operations freeze the program)

Asynchronous code allows tasks to run without blocking the main thread.

✔ Does NOT wait for a task to finish
✔ Frees the program to run other code
✔ Uses callbacks, promises, async/await

Common async operations:

setTimeout

fetch

reading files

database calls
===================================================================

13. What is a Promise? Explain its states.
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

It allows you to write async code in a cleaner way compared to callbacks (avoids callback hell).

A Promise acts as a placeholder for a value that will be available now, later, or never.
| State         | Meaning                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **pending**   | Initial state — operation is still running            |
| **fulfilled** | Operation completed successfully (`resolve()` called) |
| **rejected**  | Operation failed (`reject()` called)                  |
============================================================================

14. What is async/await?
async/await is a modern JavaScript syntax (ES8) used to work with Promises in a cleaner and more readable way.

It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.

When you put async before a function:

✔ The function always returns a Promise
✔ The returned value is automatically wrapped in a Promise

AWAIT pauses the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.

✔ Can only be used inside async functions
✔ Makes asynchronous code behave like synchronous
=======================================================================
15. What is DOM and how does it work?

DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
It represents the webpage as a tree structure of objects so that JavaScript can interact with it.

In simple terms:

👉 The DOM is how JavaScript sees, reads, and manipulates the webpage.

Document
 └── html
      ├── head
      └── body
            └── h1
                 └── "Hello"
JavaScript can:

✔ Add elements
✔ Remove elements
✔ Change text
✔ Change styles
✔ Handle user events (click, input, scroll, etc.)
========================================================================

16. What is event delegation?
Event Delegation is a JavaScript technique where instead of adding event listeners to multiple child elements, you add a single event listener to a parent element and handle events using event bubbling.

In simple words:
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
    console.log("Button clicked:", e.target.textContent);
  }
});
/======================================================================

17. What is a higher-order function?

1️⃣ Takes another function as an argument,
OR
2️⃣ Returns a function,
OR both.
1. Function taking another function as an argument
2. Function returning another function
3. Array methods (built-in HOFs)
